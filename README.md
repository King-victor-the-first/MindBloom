Project Overview and Core Challenge
MindBloom is built to directly address the critical mental health crisis plaguing university students at institutions like EKSU and beyond, a crisis driven by intense academic pressure, profound social isolation, and significant financial strain, which leaves traditional, costly, and time-consuming counseling services inaccessible to the people who need them most. We aim to revolutionize student support by creating an immediate, always-available, and completely confidential mental wellness ecosystem that fundamentally changes the delivery model from reactive crisis response to proactive, consistent care. 

The MindBloom Solution and Unique Value Proposition
Our solution centers on the Gemini AI Voice Therapist, a 24/7 companion that provides therapeutic voice sessions designed to mimic natural, free-hand conversation, immediately removing the barriers of cost and appointment wait times that block students from seeking help. The critical differentiator for MindBloom is its focus on proactive intervention; instead of waiting for the user to open the app, the AI is capable of initiating scheduled "call-outs" to prompt the user into a session if they have missed a check-in or if tracked data indicates an escalating struggle, ensuring support is delivered precisely when it is needed most. The application further fosters holistic wellness through integrated tools for tracking key biological and emotional indicators, including sleep quality, mood assessment, medication reminders, and a unique Mood Spinner that encourages positive social actions.
Key Features and User Experience (UX/UI)
The user interface of MindBloom is engineered with a mobile-first, minimalist design using Tailwind CSS, focusing on a soothing, non-intrusive color palette and fluid, rounded corners to create a calming digital environment, specifically adapting to the bottom navigation pattern for effortless single-thumb access to all core features. The most dominant UX component is the AI Voice Call Interface, which takes over the entire screen during a session to eliminate distraction, providing a clean display of transcription and allowing the user to focus entirely on the therapeutic conversation without overwhelming visual noise. The Activity and Wellness Tracker provides a centralized, private journal for recording daily activities and assessing mood, linking with mock Google Fit data (steps) to offer personalized, actionable insights generated by the AI, while the Anonymous Peer Chat provides a vital community layer, offering a secure, encrypted space where students can interact, moderated by both human and AI oversight to ensure safety and positive engagement.
Technology Stack and Data Model
MindBloom is built on a modern, scalable, and real-time capable technology stack that ensures maximum performance and reliability for a live wellness platform. The frontend is powered by React for dynamic component architecture, styled exclusively using Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first design, guaranteeing a flawless experience across all mobile devices and screen orientations. The backend is anchored by Google Firestore, utilized as a real-time, NoSQL database to securely manage complex data models including encrypted user mood logs, personalized medication schedules, and the real-time, anonymous group chat messages, all organized within the /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/... and /artifacts/{appId}/public/... structures as required for secure multi-user environments. The applicationâ€™s intelligence and core function are driven by the Gemini API for sophisticated natural language understanding and generation, providing the empathetic, context-aware responses necessary for effective AI therapy sessions, while a dedicated Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine is implemented for the lifelike, proactive voice call experience.
Getting Started and Local Usage
To set up and run MindBloom locally, developers must first ensure they have Node.js and npm installed, then clone the repository and install the dependencies. The core application logic resides within a single, self-contained React component file to streamline development and deployment, leveraging environment variables for Firebase and Gemini API configurations, particularly requiring a valid Gemini API key to enable the core voice therapy functionality. Once setup is complete, the application can be launched using a standard development server command, which will compile the single React application and open it in the browser, allowing the developer to immediately test the real-time Firestore connectivity, the proactive AI call logic, and the user-friendly mobile navigation experience.
