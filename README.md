<b>MindBloom</b> is a dedicated mental wellness companion tackling the escalating mental health crisis faced by university students, particularly those under immense academic and financial stress who lack access to affordable, confidential support. We directly solve the barriers of high cost and long wait times by offering the Gemini AI Voice Therapist, available 24/7 for realistic, empathetic voice-based therapy sessions.

Our platform is uniquely built for proactive care. MindBloom goes beyond typical chat applications by incorporating scheduled AI "call-outs," where the Voice Therapist initiates a session if a user forgets or exhibits signs of struggle, effectively interrupting decline before it escalates. This is complemented by holistic wellness tracking—including daily mood assessment, sleep quality, simulated step data, and medication reminders—and an AI-moderated, anonymous peer-to-peer community chat, empowering students to build consistent self-care habits and find safe connection. MindBloom delivers immediate, preventative, and confidential support to the students who need it most. Our platform is uniquely built for proactive care.
