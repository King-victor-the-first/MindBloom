# **App Name**: MindBloom MVP

## Core Features:

- AI Therapy Session via Gemini: Initiate voice call therapy sessions powered by Gemini AI. Implement hand-free voice interaction for discussions. Access to Gemini functionality will be gated by a tool determining suitability for purpose, and risk assessment for harmful or misleading use.
- Mood Assessment: Log and track the daily moods of the user.
- Mood Improvement - Spin Wheel: Mood enhancement recommendations presented in a 'spin wheel' format.
- Activity Tracker: Enable users to log daily activities and reflect on how these influence the user's mood.
- Medication Reminder: Set medication reminders within the application.
- Anonymous Peer-to-Peer Group Chat: Provide an encrypted peer-to-peer chat that can be used by patients who may be in distress.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sea green (#3CB371) to align with the green leaves in the MindBloom logo, evoking a sense of tranquility.
- Background color: Very light sea green (#E0F8E6), which is 20% saturation and 93% brightness
- Accent color: Blue (#708090) that offers a more modern feel with a greater level of contrast and freshness
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif with an elegant and high-end feel; body font: 'PT Sans', a more readable and humanist sans-serif that pairs well with Playfair. This pairing enhances readability and combines formality with clarity.
- Use clean, line-based icons that are consistent with the app's calming theme. Icons should be intuitive and provide clear visual cues for navigation and functionality.
- Implement a bottom navigation bar (except during therapy sessions) for easy access to key features. The layout should prioritize simplicity and ease of use.
- Subtle, gentle animations (e.g., a soft fade-in or slide-up) for transitions and interactive elements. The goal is to create a smooth and calming user experience.
