  User's Mood: {{{mood}}}
  
  Today's Survey:
  - Stress Level: {{{stress}}}
  - Places visited: {{#each location}}{{{this}}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
  - Felt accomplished: {{{accomplishment}}}
  - Took time for self-care: {{{selfCare}}}
  - Fresh Air: {{{freshAir}}}
  - Connected with someone: {{{connected}}}
  - Did something for enjoyment: {{{enjoyment}}}
  - Last night's sleep: {{{sleep}}}
  - Took Medication: {{{medication}}}

  Based on this, provide a concise summary and one or two actionable, positive insights. Focus on connections between their activities and mood. For example, if they felt good and got fresh air, highlight that connection. If they felt bad and their sleep was poor, gently suggest that might be a factor. Be sensitive and supportive in your tone.
